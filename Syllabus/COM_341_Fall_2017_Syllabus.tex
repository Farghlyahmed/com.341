    \section{Course Overview}

        The course introduces students to the fundamentals of operating systems
        design and implementation. Topics include an overview of the components
        of an operating system, implementation of processes and threads, scheduling
        algorithms, memory management and file systems. This course is designed
        for Software Engineering majors and minors.

    \section{Exams}

        Students will have to take midterm and final examinations on topics
        discussed during lectures. Each examination is in the form of a quiz
        with a set of open and multiple choice questions.

    \section{Practice Tasks}

        Students are required to finish four practice tasks during the course.\\

        In the first task students will take a look on how communication with
        the kernel works from the user space of an operating system. The task is
        to make a simple interactive shell not to rely on any C run-time or
        standard libraries. Students will do that by making system calls
        directly to the kernel on Linux, FreeBSD, or macOS in x86, or ARM
        assembly.\\

        In the second task students will take a look on how system calls are
        processed on the kernel side. They will have to add a new subsystem to a
        Linux kernel and a number of system calls to query information about
        running processes without using the \textit{/proc} virtual file
        system.\\

        The third task is to study the scheduling subsystem of the Linux kernel
        and to modify it to allow requests from processes owned by privileged
        users for the maximum possible amount of CPU time for the calling
        process and its parents.\\

        The final task is to get a look on an implementation of a custom user
        space file system for \href{https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse}{FUSE}
        on *nix or \href{https://github.com/dokan-dev/dokany}{Dokany} on
        Windows. Students will have to write several management utilities to
        create and defragment the file system at hand.

    \section{Course Projects}

        Students are required to finish two course projects.\\

        The first project is to develop a limited simulation of an OS kernel on
        top of an emulated computer system. In a simplified environment students
        will get a chance to build all major parts of a working preemptive
        kernel such as a scheduler, a virtual memory manager, and a file system
        driver in a high-level language.\\

        The second course project is to port a working subsystem from the
        simulated computer environment from the first project to an x86 kernel
        developed at AUCA. Students will have to port their code from a
        high-level language to C and assembly and adapt it to work on a real
        hardware.

    \section{Rules}

        Students are required to follow the rules of conduct of the Software
        Engineering Department and American University of Central Asia.

        Team work is NOT encouraged. The same blocks of code or similar
        structural pieces in separate works will be considered as academic
        dishonesty and all parties will get zero for the task.
